# Project_Dog-and-Cat-Classification-using-CNN
In this project, I have build a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify images of dog and cat, and tune a convolutional network with Keras for image classification, ImageDataGenerator to augment your dataset and limit overfitting and finally using transfer learning with VGG 16 architecture.
